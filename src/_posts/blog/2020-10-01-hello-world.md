## Hello World! :wave:

It took 15 commits and 5 days to realise that having a personal site built purely with HTML, CSS, and JS was going to be a ~~nightmare~~ challenge in the long run. Realistically I just want to show off some projects, produce some guides on what I find difficult to get answers for, and the occasional post here and there - what I don't really want to be doing is handcrafting every single little button with loving care and attention for hours on end when I could be focusing on what's important.  

## Jekyll & Liquid to the Rescue!

I've never used [Jekyll][jekyll] before but from the docs and a few projects I've seen it looks like a very suitable static site generator with a large supporting community behind it. The idea of just writing all my posts in [Markdown][markdown] as well as using the [Liquid][liquid] template engine and having it all just work *like magic* :tada: is very appealing!  

## Dark Poole

The home page for this site is just migrated over from the old version however the [blog][blog] and [projects][projects] links will be making full of use of Jekyll and the theme I've chosen currently is [Dark Poole][dark-poole] by [Andrew Park][andrew-park] as you've got to love a good dark theme!

The theme itself has made it a lot easier to quickly generate the Jekyll site structure but I've made a few changes including:

* Adding the subtitle as a variable
* Adding a little more space between the header tags for some breathing room
* Reducing the size of the posted date
* Tag system (based from one made by [Ryan Palo][ryan-palo])
* Plus a few more tweaks!
