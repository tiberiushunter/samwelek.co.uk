## What Cookies and Scripts have we got in place?

### Cookie: `cookie-approval-status`

#### *Retention Period: 31 days*

This cookie controls whether or not the `Cookie and Scripts` banner is shown on the bottom of every screen.

The purpose of this is to track whether or not a user has given us their consent to allow certain third party cookies and scripts to run.

If the `Decline` button on the banner is clicked then we store that approval has **not been given** and all third party cookies and scripts will be disabled, except for the ones that provide core functionality that without would render the website non functional and useless.
