## Hello World!

It took 15 commits and 5 days to realise that having a personal site built purely with HTML, CSS, and JS was going to be a <del>nightmare</del> challenge in the long run. Realistically I just want to show off some projects, produce some guides on what I find difficult to get answers for, and the occasional post here and there - what I don't really want to be doing is handcrafting every single little button with loving care and attention for hours on end when I could be focusing on what's important.  

## Jekyll to the Rescue!

I've never used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before but from the docs and a few projects I've seen it looks like a very suitable static site generator with a large supporting community behind it. The idea of just writing all the posts in Markdown and having it all just work like **magic** :tada: is very appealing!  

## Dark Poole

The home page for this site is just migrated over from the old version however the [blog](https://samwelek.co.uk/blog/) and [projects](https://samwelek.co.uk/projects/) links will be making full of use of Jekyll and the theme I've chosen currently is [Dark Poole](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole) by [Andrew Park](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark) as you've got to love a good dark theme!
