## Hello World! :wave:

It took 15 commits and 5 days to realise that having a personal site built purely with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> was going to be a <del>nightmare</del> challenge in the long run. Realistically I just want to show off some projects, produce some guides on what I find difficult to get answers for, and the occasional post here and there - what I don't really want to be doing is handcrafting every single little button with loving care and attention for hours on end when I could be focusing on what's important.  

## Jekyll to the Rescue!

I've never used [Jekyll][1] before but from the docs and a few projects I've seen it looks like a very suitable static site generator with a large supporting community behind it. The idea of just writing all the posts in [Markdown][2] and having it all just work *like magic* :tada: is very appealing!  

## Dark Poole

The home page for this site is just migrated over from the old version however the [blog][2] and [projects][4] links will be making full of use of Jekyll and the theme I've chosen currently is [Dark Poole][5] by [Andrew Park][6] as you've got to love a good dark theme! 

The theme itself has made it a lot easier to quickly generate the Jekyll site structure but I've made a few changes including:

* Adding the subtitle as a variable
* Adding a little more space between the header tags for some breathing room
* Reducing the size of the posted date
* Tag system (based from one made by [Ryan Palo][7])
* Plus a few more tweaks!
